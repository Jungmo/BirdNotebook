## Contribution
* We suggest energy efficient system architecture for monitoring environmental phenomena using wireless image sensor networks.
* For building autonomous classifying system, we built a deep learning model using state-of-arts network model.
* We applied image processing for raw image to reduce amount of data to be transmitted and evaluate the relation between traffic and classification accuracy.
